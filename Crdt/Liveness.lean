# State-based CRDTs — liveness (the "Eventual" half of SEC)

`Crdt.Convergence` proves the **safety** half of Strong Eventual Consistency: replicas
that have delivered the *same set* of updates hold equal state. That theorem is silent
on whether the same set is ever actually delivered — it takes an already-delivered
`Finset`/`List`. This file supplies the missing **liveness** half.

You cannot prove a network delivers messages, so liveness is **conditional**: under an
explicit *fairness* assumption (every generated update eventually reaches every replica)
and *quiescence* (the set of generated updates is finite and fixed), every replica
eventually reaches — and thereafter holds — the join of all updates, and any two
replicas eventually agree. The fairness assumption is a hypothesis of `DeliverySystem`,
not something proved; that is the honest boundary between what Lean can certify and what
the network layer must guarantee.

The whole argument rests on one combinatorial lemma, `eventually_covers`: monotone
delivery plus "each element eventually arrives" forces "the whole finite set is
eventually present", by taking the max of finitely many arrival times.

/-- **Core liveness lemma.** If a delivery history `d` is monotone in time and every
element of a finite set `s` is delivered at *some* time, then there is a *single* time
`T` by which the *entire* set `s` has been delivered. The proof inducts on `s`, taking
the max of the per-element arrival times. -/

/-- A **delivery system**: a finite, fixed pool of generated update-states (quiescence)
gossiped to a family of replicas `ι`, where delivery is monotone, sound (no phantom
updates), and fair (every update eventually reaches every replica). The fairness field
is the honest network assumption: it is asserted, not derived. -/

/-- **Per-replica convergence.** Under fairness + quiescence, each replica reaches the
full update set after some finite time and *stays* there: `delivered r t = allUpdates`
for all sufficiently large `t`. Soundness gives `⊆`, the liveness lemma gives `⊇`. -/

/-- **Eventual agreement (the full SEC payoff).** Any two replicas eventually hold
identical state, forever after some finite time — combining the liveness lemma here with
the safety result `replicaState` is a function of the delivered set. Take the max of the
two convergence times. -/
