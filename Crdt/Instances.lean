# State-based CRDTs — concrete instances

`Crdt.Defs`/`Convergence`/`Liveness` prove Strong Eventual Consistency and conditional
liveness for *any* carrier that is a `SemilatticeSup` with `OrderBot` and decidable
equality. This file discharges that obligation for three textbook CRDTs, so each one
inherits SEC + liveness **for free** — no per-type re-proof:

* **G-Set** (grow-only set) — `Finset α`, merge = `∪`.
* **G-Counter** (grow-only counter) — `ι → ℕ`, merge = pointwise `max`, value = `∑`.
* **PN-Counter** (increment/decrement counter) — a pair of G-Counters, value = `P − N`.

For each we (a) confirm Mathlib already supplies the required lattice instances, (b)
state the concrete merge equation, (c) re-export SEC and eventual-agreement at the
concrete type, and (d) prove the *semantic read* (membership, counter value) is
**monotone** under delivery — the application-level statement an operator actually
cares about: replicas only ever move forward.

The honest boundary from `Crdt.Liveness` is unchanged: liveness is conditional on the
`DeliverySystem` fairness field. These instances make the abstract guarantee concrete,
they do not weaken it.
