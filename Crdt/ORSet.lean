# The OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) — an add-wins CRDT

`Crdt.Instances` discharges the *easy* CvRDT instances (G-Set, counters), where the
lattice carries everything and `merge` is plainly correct. This file does the **hard**
one: the **OR-Set**, the CRDT whose merge logic is genuinely subtle and where naive
designs (the 2P-Set) ship the wrong behaviour.

The classic failure: with a plain grow-only set you can never remove; with a 2P-Set
(add-set + remove-set of *elements*) a removed element can never be re-added — and a
*concurrent* add and remove resolves to absent, losing the add. The OR-Set fixes this by
tagging every add with a **unique token** and tombstoning *tokens*, not elements. A
remove only tombstones the tokens it has **observed**; a concurrent add mints a fresh
token the remove never saw, so the add **wins**.

## Model

State is a pair of grow-only sets: `adds : Finset (α × τ)` (element tagged with a unique
token) and `removed : Finset τ` (tombstoned tokens). As a product of two G-Sets it is a
`SemilatticeSup` with `OrderBot`, so `merge = ⊔` is componentwise union and the library's
Strong Eventual Consistency + liveness theorems apply **for free**. The content of this
file is the *semantic* layer on top: what `lookup` returns, and the add-wins guarantee.

## What is actually proved (the moat)

* `add_wins` — a fresh add merged with a concurrent remove of the same element leaves the
  element **present**. This is the defining OR-Set property and the one a 2P-Set gets
  wrong.
* `remove_lookup_false` — absent a concurrent add, remove genuinely removes.
* `add_lookup` — a fresh add makes the element present.
* SEC + eventual agreement, inherited unchanged from the abstract carrier.
