# Causal-Cut Consumable Authority (CCCA) — the authority frontier, necessity v0

A single-use right ("authority") whose bytes replicate freely cannot be
simultaneously LIVE in two disconnected failure domains — unless the system
is willing to double-spend it. Formally, necessity only: **operational
safety (at most one completed consume, judged on receipts alone) plus the
asynchronous consume-diamond implies the live authority frontier has
cardinality ≤ 1** at every reachable configuration whose domains are
pairwise disconnected. Plus a **checked counterexample**: copyable bytes at
two domains, no coordination — both consume, the receipt union carries two
completed consumes, at-most-once is violated.

## The one rule (anti-tautology discipline)

`live` and `frontier` are **derived observers** over freely-replicated
monotone state — copyable bytes plus grow-only receipts — never primitives:

* `Safe` mentions ONLY completed receipts (`receipts`, a `Finset` that only
  grows along steps);
* `live c d` means only that `d` can take a possible LOCAL consume step
  given what has been delivered to it;
* the bridge between them is the operational amalgamation lemma
  (`no_disconnected_double_availability`): two disconnected live domains
  can BOTH fire — `step_live`, then `frozen_live` (a disconnected step
  cannot revoke remote enablement: the asynchrony square), then `step_live`
  again — and the two receipts land, contradicting safety.

There is no owner field, no uniqueness axiom, and no handoff in the
definition of enablement. Concurrent enablement is *not* a contradiction by
definition — the unsafe model below realizes it (and pays for it).

## Named assumptions (each law is one field, so every apparent escape
   traces to exactly one name)

* `step_live` — locally enabled steps can fire (no hidden global lock);
* `step_reachable` — reachability is closed under steps;
* `receipts_step` — a consume step completes: the stepping domain's receipt
  is recorded and receipts only grow;
* `frozen_live` — LOCALITY: a step in a disconnected domain cannot revoke
  another domain's enablement (the async square of the consume-diamond).

Escape hatches, each breaking exactly one named assumption:
* **quorum consensus** — majority quorums intersect, so two
  quorum-satisfying domains are never `disconnected`;
* **epoch / lease expiry** — an external clock edge revoking remote
  enablement violates `frozen_live` (it is an oracle communication);
* **randomized consume** — per-outcome only; the diamond survives, safety
  becomes probabilistic, outside `Safe`'s certainty claim;
* **delayed receipts / reconciliation** — detection, not prevention: `Safe`
  itself fails at the offending cut; the frontier claim is untouched;
* **signatures** — authenticate the bytes but do not allocate the one-shot
  right: `live` has no unforgeability input and the bytes stay copyable.

## Intended interpretation (SealV2, mapping only — the theorem lives here)

Approval bytes → the copyable replicated state; completed consume receipt →
a successful `validateAndConsumeWithStore` write of the nonce into a
domain's replay store; failure domain → a disconnected replica of that
store; `Safe` → at-most-once nonce spend across domains. The concrete
refinement proof is future work, deliberately not claimed here.

## Honest non-claims

Does NOT prove: crash recovery or durability; cryptographic authenticity or
unforgeability (bytes here are abstract and copyable — this models
replication, not forgery-resistance); Byzantine safety; correctness of any
clock, lease, quorum, or epoch scheme; conformance of the deployed SealV2
implementation; liveness during partitions; SUFFICIENCY of any escrow or
handoff protocol; and no novelty beyond invariant confluence / escrow CRDTs
is claimed — this necessity direction is close to a corollary of Bailis
et al.'s invariant confluence (arXiv:1402.2237) and bounded-counter escrow
(arXiv:1503.09052); it is honest repo infrastructure and the mesh spine,
not new distributed-systems theory.

**Unproved conjecture (recorded, deliberately NOT formalized here — no
axiom, no placeholder declaration): the handoff-or-gap normal form.** Every
safe transfer of live authority between disconnected domains factors
through either a causal handoff edge whose past seals the sender's consume
potential, or a cut where the frontier is empty. The finite probe evidence
below (`ccca_edge_only_still_unsafe` vs `ccca_safe_world_*`) is consistent
with it; the general characterization is the next brick.

Six events over two domains — `0` enableL · `1` disableL · `2` consumeL ·
`3` enableR · `4` disableR · `5` consumeR — with an explicit strict causal
order per world. Cuts are down-closed event sets; an event's firing
conditions are judged over ITS OWN causal past (what its domain had seen);
`cutLive` is the derived possible-local-step observer. All checks are
kernel-`decide`d (no `native_decide`). Probe verdicts:

* `wUnsafe` (no coordination): double-consume expressible (TEETH) and a
  both-live cut exists;
* `wEdgeOnly` (disable→enable causal edge, sender potential UNSEALED):
  STILL unsafe — the edge alone is insufficient;
* `wSafe` (edge AND the disable seals the sender's consume potential):
  safe, the receiver becomes genuinely live (the transfer works), and no
  cut has both domains live. -/

/-! ## Sealed-handoff SUFFICIENCY (the third mesh brick)

The sufficiency half of the recorded handoff conjecture, discharged:
**a sealed-handoff world is Safe** — every valid closed cut carries at most
one completed consume (`sealed_handoff_safe`, a general `CutWorld` theorem
with a structural proof; `decide` is used only for finite witnesses).

**The seal is ONE causal edge.** Diffing `wEdgeOnly` (unsafe) against
`wSafe` (safe), the only difference is `lt disableL consumeL`: the disable
sits in the causal past of the sender's OWN consume, tripping `fires`'
no-same-domain-disable clause. `SealedHandoff` states exactly that, as a
PURE causal-order predicate over `w.lt` + `peDisable`/`peConsume`/`peDomL`
— it mentions no receipts, no `Safe`, no cardinality, and none of the
necessity theorems (the non-circularity kill line). Its discriminating
fact against `wEdgeOnly` is the order bit `wEdgeOnly.lt 1 2 = false`
(`wEdgeOnly_no_seal_edge`), decided independently of any double-consume
outcome.

**Vacuity discharge (Codex's caveat):** the event vocabulary is fixed —
every `CutWorld` carries both consume events (2 and 5) — so
`SealedHandoff`'s universal ranges over exactly one consume potential per
domain and is never vacuously satisfied; no transfer-classification,
origin, or coverage clauses are needed.

**Why there is no biconditional (the tautology trap, and a discovery):**
the naive gap disjunct "∃ a cut with an empty frontier" is VACUOUSLY true —
at `C = ∅` nobody is live, in every world (`gap_vacuous`), so
`Safe ⟺ handoff ∨ gap` would collapse to `Safe ⟺ True`. Worse, the probe
found a THIRD safe shape: **causal consume-sequencing** (`wSeq`) — the
sender's consume sits in the receiver's causal past (`wSeq.lt 2 5 = true`),
so `fires`' no-consume-in-view clause kills the receiver's potential; the
world is Safe (`wSeq_safe`) with NO sealed handoff
(`wSeq_not_sealed_handoff`) and a genuinely live sender
(`wSeq_sender_live`). The two-disjunct normal form recorded by the v0
conjecture above is therefore INCOMPLETE as stated: any future
characterization must account for at least {sealed handoff, genuine gap,
consume-sequencing}, with "gap" needing a sharper definition than
empty-frontier-somewhere. The conjecture text above is kept verbatim as the
historical record; this paragraph is the refinement.

**Honest scope:** sufficiency only — this does NOT claim the sealed
handoff is the unique safe shape (`wSeq` refutes exactly that), and it is
proven over the finite `CutWorld` probe model, not the abstract
`AuthoritySystem` (which has no causal order to state the pattern over —
lifting sufficiency to an abstract causal setting is a later brick). The
landed novelty disclaimer applies unchanged. -/

/-- The sealed-handoff pattern, as PURE causal order: some domain (the
sender) has every one of its consume potentials sealed — a same-domain
disable in the potential's own causal past. Reads only `w.lt` and the
event vocabulary; no receipts, no safety, no cardinality. -/

/-! ## Layer D — sufficiency at the abstract level: the probe, the no-go, the lift

**Probe verdict (recorded before the lift): the literal lift is REFUTED.**
`CutWorld.SealedHandoff` cannot be stated over the bare `AuthoritySystem`
(no events, no causal order, no disable vocabulary — the boundary already
named in Layer C's honest-scope note), and more fundamentally NO
discriminating predicate over the bare signature can imply `Safe`:

* **The generation gap.** `reachable` is an arbitrary step-closed FIELD
  with no induction principle, and `receipts` at reachable configurations
  are unconstrained except along steps. Sufficiency is an invariant
  argument — base case plus preservation — and the bare structure has no
  base case. `StepFreeSystem` below makes this a kernel-checked no-go: a
  system with NO steps and NO liveness (so every step/live-shaped pattern
  holds vacuously, including the direct analogue of the sealed-handoff
  predicate) whose constant receipts already violate safety
  (`sufficiency_needs_generation`). A predicate that survives this
  countermodel must constrain `receipts` at reachable configurations
  directly — i.e. restate `Safe`, the kill-line violation.

**The lift, at the honest price.** Sufficiency holds one level up, over
`GeneratedAuthoritySystem`: the bare system plus exactly the structure the
`CutWorld` probe model provides for free — an initial configuration with
empty receipts, reachability generated from it (an induction principle),
and steps that fire only when live (`CutWorld`'s `validCut`/`fires`
discipline). Over that structure, `SealedSenders` — every domain except a
designated receiver is never live at any reachable configuration — implies
safety (`sealed_senders_safe`), with a structural proof and no finiteness
assumption on `D`. This is the maximal available generality: the no-go
shows the two added laws cannot be dropped.

**Kill-line discipline (the predicate is discriminating, not Safe
restated).** `SealedSenders` mentions only `live` and `reachable` — no
receipts, no cardinality. `CopySystem` instantiates the generated laws
(`CopyGenerated`) and FAILS the predicate (`copy_not_sealed_senders`) — as
it must, being unsafe. And the correspondence with Layer C is checked, not
asserted: in `wSafe` the sealed sender is never `cutLive` at ANY cut
(`wSafe_sender_never_live`) — `SealedSenders` is exactly that shape, one
level up: the abstract shadow of `CutWorld.SealedHandoff`'s derived effect
(`seal_blocks_fires`), stating the seal's operational content (the sender
is never live) where no causal order exists to state its FORM (the
disable-before-consume edge).

**No biconditional, again.** `SeqSystem` — the abstract mirror of `wSeq`'s
consume-sequencing — is Safe (`seq_safe`) with BOTH domains live at the
initial configuration (`seq_both_live_init`), hence no sealed sender
(`seq_not_sealed_senders`). Sufficiency only, exactly as in Layer C. -/

/-- **The no-go countermodel.** No steps, no liveness, constant two-element
receipts, everything reachable. Every `AuthoritySystem` law holds
(vacuously); every pattern over `step`/`live` holds (vacuously); safety
fails. Sufficiency cannot live at this generality. -/

`Safe`. So over the bare `AuthoritySystem` the predicate does not imply
safety; the lift genuinely needs generated reachability. -/

/-! ## Layer E — the normal-form STEP-0 enumerator and the shape observers

STEP 0 of the normal-form brick, same probe-before-proving discipline as
Layer C: before any characterization theorem is attempted, a finite
ENUMERATOR of probe worlds must confirm that a safe-LOOKING trajectory that
is neither a witnessed handoff nor a gap is EXPRESSIBLE — otherwise any
normal form proved over this model would be vacuous (it would "hold" only
because the model cannot write down the alternative).

**The enumerator.** `probeWorld m`, for `m : Fin 256`: the family of causal
orders generated by the 256 subsets of the 8-edge basis `probeEdge`, with
`lt` = path-reachability along the selected edges (fuel 4 = paths of ≤ 5
edges, enough because every basis edge strictly increases the event index,
so no path repeats a node). Irreflexivity is generic and structural
(`probeWorld_irrefl`, via `probeReach_lt`); full strictness (with
transitivity) is discharged per witness world by pointwise identification
with a named world. The family CONTAINS all four landed Layer C worlds
(`probeWorld_99/107/111/82` identify them by index) plus the new gap world
`wGap` (`probeWorld_2`) — the enumerator is a superset of the v0 probe,
not a new model.

**The shape observers — all DERIVED, pure causal order.** They read only
`w.lt` and the fixed event vocabulary; no receipts, no safety, no
liveness, and none of them appears in any firing rule (the kill line:
handoff stays in the CONCLUSION, never in the definition of enablement):

* `Unenabled e` — GAP at the potential: no same-domain enable in `e`'s
  causal past; the domain never acquires the authority at all;
* `SealWitnessed e` — a same-domain disable causally precedes `e` (the
  Layer C seal, stated per potential);
* `SeqWitnessed e` — some consume event causally precedes `e` (the `wSeq`
  shape);
* `RelinquishWitnessed e` = seal ∨ sequencing — the "handoff" disjunct in
  its honest form: a causal witness that a relinquish event precedes the
  dead potential. HONESTY: this is WEAKER than the v0 conjecture's
  informal "the authority moves" — `wSeq` and `wGap` are safe worlds in
  which no authority ever moves, so movement cannot be a necessary
  disjunct. The provable disjunct is a witnessed relinquish, not a
  completed transfer.

**Probe verdicts (the STEP-0 outcome, recorded before the Layer F
proofs):**

* `step0_alternative_expressible` — the GO condition: probe world 107
  (= `wEdgeOnly`) is strict; NEITHER of its consume potentials is
  unenabled, sealed, or sequenced (no gap, no witness of any kind); a
  valid closed cut has BOTH domains simultaneously live (every local rule
  is satisfied — the trajectory looks safe to every local observer); and a
  valid closed cut carries TWO completed consumes. The
  neither-handoff-nor-gap trajectory is expressible, and only the safety
  hypothesis excludes it. The normal form is not vacuous.
* `step0_gap_world_expressible` — probe world 2 (= `wGap`) is strict,
  safe, has a genuinely live sender, NO relinquish witness anywhere, and
  an UNENABLED receiver potential (while the sender's potential is
  enabled): the gap disjunct does real, discriminating work — contrast
  `gap_vacuous`, which killed the naive cut-level "empty frontier
  somewhere" gap.
* `step0_seal_shape` / `step0_seq_shape` — worlds 111 (= `wSafe`) and 82
  (= `wSeq`) realize the seal and sequencing shapes EXCLUSIVELY: each
  satisfies its own witness and provably fails the other two shapes. The
  three shapes are pairwise independent — none subsumes another. -/
