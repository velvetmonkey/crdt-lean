# Sequence CRDT (RGA-family) — convergence to an identical ordered sequence

The OR-Set (`Crdt.ORSet`) is the hard *unordered* CRDT. This file does the hard
*ordered* one: a **replicated sequence** (the RGA / Logoot / Treedoc family), where the
distinctive obligation is that every replica converges not just to the same *set* of
elements but to the same *ordered list*, and the relative order of any two surviving
elements is independent of the order in which operations were delivered.

## Model

Each inserted element carries a globally unique **position identifier** drawn from a
densely-ordered type `ι` with a `LinearOrder`. We abstract identifier *allocation* (the
insert-after-with-timestamp-tiebreak machinery RGA/Logoot use to mint a fresh position
between two neighbours) into "you are handed a fresh `ι`", exactly as `Crdt.ORSet`
abstracted unique add-tokens. What we prove is the convergence layer above allocation.

State is a pair of grow-only sets: `placed : Finset (ι × α)` (positioned elements) and
`tombstones : Finset ι` (deleted positions). As a product of two G-Sets it is a
`SemilatticeSup` with `OrderBot`, so `merge` is componentwise union and Strong Eventual
Consistency + liveness apply **for free** at the state level. The content here is the
**read**: the live position identifiers enumerated in order (each identifier carrying its
element value by lookup). Identifiers are totally ordered, so the enumeration is a
deterministic function of *which positions are live* — never of delivery history.

## What is proved (the moat)

* `read_sorted` — the read is sorted by identifier: the sequence order is a deterministic
  function of positions, never of history.
* `read_strong_eventual_consistency` — replicas that delivered the same set of operations
  produce the **identical ordered sequence** (sequence-level SEC, lifted from state SEC).
* `read_determined` — the read depends only on the live set, not on the delivery path.
* `read_nodup`, `mem_read` — the read is duplicate-free and exactly the live positions.
* `delete_not_read` / `insert_read` — tombstoning removes a position from the sequence; a
  fresh insert at a live position makes it appear.
